TRYOUT is for champs you want to try out with new builds (found/crafted)\r\n\r\n### Other cool stuff:\r\n\r\n- Item build optimizer (secretly weird but op builds)\r\n  - [http://www.leagueoflegendsmath.com/Item_Optimizer.html](http://www.leagueoflegendsmath.com/Item_Optimizer.html)\r\n  - [Item set builder for ^](http://www.leagueoflegendsmath.com/Item_Set_Creator_Instructions.html)\r\n- Secret OP geeZy Veigar build\r\n  - Masteries: Deathfire with spell vamp Runes: MS quints, Mpen Reds, Health/lvl yellows, Mana regen blues\r\n  - Skill Order: R > Q > W / E every other level (start with W)\r\n  - Build: Corrupting > Morello&Boots > Hextech Gunblade > Lich Bane > Deathcap > Zhonya > Void\r\n    - Build zhonya earlier if needed\r\n  - Why OP? 600 heal on ult, 300 heal on W/Q, 40% CDR, additional .8 AP targeted on hit (hextech/lich)\r\n  - Just don't die early, back and give tower if needed, it doesn't matter with veigar. You can bait with ur R heal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Videos!\r\n\r\n\r\n        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yx4UA7BFFk0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IPaKtq5WQg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n        ",
